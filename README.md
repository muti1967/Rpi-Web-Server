# RPI Web Server
Raspberry Pi hosted Website V 1.4

This website is being hosted on my personal server at home! I've installed nginx, configured my own domain, and set up SSL encryption as well! Feel free to navigate around. (I moved from using SCTP to configurating github to push and deploy all my own content!) Soon to come: I plan on formulating a guide for those who would like to follow the same steps.
