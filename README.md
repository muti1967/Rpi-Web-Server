# RPI Web Server
Raspberry Pi hosted Website V 1.5

This website is being hosted on my personal server at home! 
I've installed nginx, configured my own domain, and set up SSL encryption as well! Feel free to navigate around.
Feel free to check out the resulting website at www.mutishuman.com!

Portfolio Site Features:
 - SSL encryptrion
 - Active Firewall
 - Auto updates
 - Auto virus and secruity checks daily
 - Auto pull & push requests
I plan to formulate a guide for others to be able to set up a secure website on their own raspberry pis at home!
